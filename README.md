# Create React App From Template
Create React apps by using custom templates. This is a wrapper of `create-react-app` so you can use all its power here. See the [create-react-app user guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) for more details.


## Install
> You must have create-react-app installed. Craft would verfiy and warn you in case create-react-app is not present.

```
npm install -g @isfco/craft
```

## Usage

```
$ craft <project-directory> <template-url> [options]

  Options:

    -V, --version  output the version number
    -h, --help     output usage information
```

`template-url` must be a remote github repository URL.

## Template
There is no assumptions on the template scaffolding. It can be literally anything. All the content will be merged with the files generated by default for `create-react-app` and overwritten in case your template has files with the same names, except for `node_modules`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.git` files and folders. They will be skept.

If your template contains a `package.json` file, the scripts and dependecies will be merged with the one generated for the app. All other sections won't be included.
