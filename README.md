## CRAFT

## TL;DR

```
npm install -g @isfco/craft
craft my-app https://github.com/cebroker/react-foundation.git
```

## Getting started

First, we need to install `craft` globally. Run:

`npm install -g @isfco/craft`

Then, you can create a react app based on the create-react-app script, but adding a custom layer from a repo. You just have to run the script and add the link to the git repository.

`craft [app_name] [github_link]`

For example, to use React Foundation:

`craft react-app https://github.com/cebroker/react-foundation.git`
